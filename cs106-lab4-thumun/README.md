# CS106 Lab 4: Stacks and Queues
## Due: April 8, Noon

Name: Neha Thumu

Number of Late Days Using for this lab: using 1 day-- 48 hour extension [to submit on 8th] (Got permission from Professor Kumar to submit by April 8th at noon without using another extension)

---
## Suggestions
1. Read the assignment at least twice -- understanding the requirement
2. Revise the relevant concepts
3. Sketch a proper plan -- design
4. Implementation-- write the code
5. Debug and test-- conduct unit testing i.e. test each peice separately and then conduct integration testing (everything together)

### Writeup

1. Describe the process you followed to arrive at the solution.

Linked Stack: 
- drew the stack in order to visualize it 
- used the textbook and powerpoint slides to help make the methods 

Deque: 
- drew it out 
- also used the textbook and powerpoint slides 

Postfix: 
- the lab directions were easy to understand along with the given code 
- just added the calculations where the print statements were 

Infix: 
- used the given wikipedia link and other sources (youtube videos and a site called geeksforgeeks) to understand what I had to do 
- honestly trial and error using debugger (finally works though! yay)


2. Describe your implementation of each part of the assignment in a layman term.

Linked Stack: 
- dused the book as a reference and made the code based on that and template (given methods)

Deque: 
- used the book as a reference and made the code based on that and template (given methods)

Postfix: 
- added code based on existing structure 
- not quite sure how to test this on it's own (without deleting the code for using shunting yard on input first)

Infix/Shunting Yard: 
- followed along with wikipedia and other sources 
- spent most of the time debugging

### Lab questionnaire

(None of your answers below will affect your grade; this is to help refine lab
assignments in the future)

1. Approximately, how many hours did you take to complete this lab? (provide
  your answer as a single integer on the line below)
  
  ~18 

2. How difficult did you find this lab? (1-5, with 5 being very difficult and 1
  being very easy)
  
  4 (because of part 4 but the rest was ok) 

3. Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab

The shunting yard was difficult. It felt simple at first but I kept running into errors as I tried to code it. The wikipedia link confused me so I ended up trying to understand from other sources.
It ended up being that the getPrecedence() was the problem.. by changing the values by 1 it all worked out?? I'm not quite sure how that ended up fixing everything but happy it works.
